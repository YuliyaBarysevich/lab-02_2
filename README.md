Feature 1 - Pagination:
Add two buttons to the top of the page - one for 'Lab 2' data set and one for 'Lab 3' data set. When the user clicks the button to the corresponding data set, only display the images from that set, both in the drop down and on the page

Feature 2 - Templating:
Create a function that renders the objects properties of title, image, and description to the page in a template. The template should have <h2>, <img>, and <p>. Use {{mustache}} templating

Feature 3 - Styling with Flexbox:
In the CSS, style our images so the images display in columns as the screen width changes. Style your page with flexbox rather than floats

Feature 4 - Sort the Images:
Add a sort button(?) to each of the 'pages' so the user can sort the images by either 'keyword' or by 'number of horns'
